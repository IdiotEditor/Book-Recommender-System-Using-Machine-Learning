## Features

- Popularity-based recommendations (Top rated + most read books)
- User-based Collaborative Filtering
- Item-based Collaborative Filtering (similar books)
- Search and recommend books by title
- Dataset preprocessing and cleaning


## Dataset

The project uses 3 CSV files from the **Book-Crossing dataset**:
- `Books.csv` â†’ Book details (Title, Author, ISBN, Image URL)
- `Users.csv` â†’ User details (User ID, Location, Age)
- `Ratings.csv` â†’ Ratings data (User ID, ISBN, Rating)

Note: `Books.csv` is large (~70 MB). GitHub may not preview it in-browser, but it can be downloaded.


## How to run?

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IdiotEditor/Book-Recommender-System-Using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Book-Recommender-System-Using-Machine-Learning
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook:
   jupyter notebook Book_Recomenrder_System.ipynb

## Usage

Example of generating recommendations:
